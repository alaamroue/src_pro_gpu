// Hydrological timestep
// This should be low to capture velocities properly, but isn't
// always necessary
// TODO: Make configurable...
// Alaa: Why make them seperate, this caused so much problems. Shouldn't the boundary condition work at the same time as the scheme
// Aren't we seperating them just to avoid read errors? If so, why would they run at a different timestep.
// TODO: Alaa: check why this was needed?
